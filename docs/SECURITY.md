# Security — what we protect against, and how

This document describes the L×Box threat model and the concrete protection mechanisms: what we close off, how exactly, and why. The traffic-leak section is covered in the most detail, because it's the least obvious part.

## 1. Threat model

L×Box is a VPN client: it accepts other apps' traffic, wraps it in a tunnel, and sends it to a remote node. Three classes of threat follow from that, and we defend against each:

| Class | Threat | Covered in |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Traffic leak** | Traffic escapes the tunnel or the routing policy — deanonymization, bypass simply doesn't work | [§2](#2-traffic-leaks-out-of-the-tunnel) |
| **Local surface** | An open local proxy/API that another app on the device could abuse | [§3](#3-local-attack-surface) |
| **Secret theft** | Private keys, device tokens, subscription credentials leak out of the app | [§4](#4-secrets-on-the-device) |

## 2. Traffic leaks out of the tunnel

### 2.1 Two matching axes: WHERE vs WHO

Every routing rule matches traffic on one of two independent axes:

- **WHERE** (destination) — by the packet's destination: `ip_cidr`, domain, port. The sender doesn't matter.
- **WHO** (source / owner) — by **which app owns the socket**: UID → package_name.

These are different sets, and they must not be conflated. Leak protection is built on both axes, but with different rules.

### 2.2 `0.0.0.0/0 → reject` — destination-address filter

`0.0.0.0/0` is the IP-CIDR for "**any IPv4 destination address**". A rule using it matches traffic on the **WHERE** axis:

```json
{ "ip_cidr": ["0.0.0.0/0"], "action": "reject" }
```

- Matches **all** IPv4 traffic indiscriminately — apps and background processes alike, regardless of owner.
- `reject` = the core drops the packet (RST / ICMP-unreachable, or a silent drop).
- Practically equivalent to `final = reject`, **if** the rule is last and nothing above it matched. The difference:
  - `final` — the fallback for traffic that **matched no rule at all**.
  - `0.0.0.0/0` — an **active** rule: it matches literally everything and short-circuits the chain, preventing rules placed below it from running.

**Purpose:** a kill-switch. "If nothing in the allowlist matched, don't let anything out." Closes leaks on the address axis.

### 2.3 Ownerless traffic: why `curl --interface tun0` bypasses attribution

The normal path for an app's traffic:

```
app socket → VpnService intercept → tun0 → core sees UID → resolves package → rules
```

The core knows the socket's UID → maps it to the `package_name` of an installed app. The traffic is "signed" by its owner.

But a process that binds **directly to the tun0 interface** (`curl --interface tun0`, termux, low-level network tools) bypasses the VpnService interception layer:

```
curl bind(tun0) → writes into tun "from the side" → core: UID = INVALID_UID → package = "" (empty)
```

Why such traffic is called **ownerless**:

- It didn't go through the normal entry point (the VpnService intercept) → the **socket owner can't be resolved** → `INVALID_UID`.
- With an empty UID, the core **can't map** the traffic to any installed app → `package` is the empty string.
- The result is traffic inside the tunnel that is **attributed to nothing**: not the system, not an app from the list — a process that crawled into tun on its own.

**Why it's dangerous:** such traffic can escape the routing policy (e.g. bypass your allowlist / detour) — it's a potential leak channel. It reproduces trivially (`curl --interface tun0 ...`), so this is a real hole, not a theoretical one.

### 2.4 The "Unknown traffic" rule — socket-owner filter

It catches the ownerless traffic from [§2.3](#23-ownerless-traffic-why-curl---interface-tun0-bypasses-attribution) — on the **WHO** axis. The `block_unknown` preset definition ([`wizard_template.json`](../app/assets/wizard_template.json)):

```json
{ "invert": true, "package_name_regex": "^" }
```

How to read it:

- `package_name_regex: "^"` — the `^` regex matches **any** string (including the empty one): "there is some package".
- `invert: true` — flips the condition → the rule catches traffic whose **package is NOT defined** (empty / `INVALID_UID`).

So the rule isolates exactly the traffic that enters the tunnel without attribution to an installed app.

**What to do with it** (the `outbound` var in the preset):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `reject` (default) | drop — ownerless traffic isn't let out at all |
| `direct` | send it outside the VPN (direct egress, bypassing the tunnel) |

**Why it's needed:**

1. **Close the leak.** A process crawling into tun behind VpnService's back can't exfiltrate traffic past the routing policy.
2. **Tunnel hygiene.** Only legitimate apps' traffic goes through the proxy; everything unattributed is brought under control (drop or direct).
3. **Different axis than §2.2.** A legitimate app with a valid UID and destination `1.2.3.4` is caught by `0.0.0.0/0`, but **not** by "Unknown traffic" — the sets barely overlap.

### 2.5 Layers: route engine vs connection journal

An important diagnostic caveat. Two independent layers touch ownerless traffic: the **route layer** (the routing engine sees the packet and its empty attribution and enforces `block_unknown`) and the **connection journal** (the Live/Profiler stream fed by the libbox CommandClient; there is no Clash API `/connections` — it was removed in the §122 CommandClient migration).

Consequences:

- "The rule fired" and "the connection shows up in the journal" describe **different layers**. The route layer always rejects ownerless `tun0`-bind traffic via `block_unknown`, regardless of what the journal shows.
- Since §176 (the profiler switched to `FilterState(All)`), an ownerless `tun0`-bind connection **does** surface in the Live/Profiler journal — as a brief open+close event — even though it is still rejected at the route layer. (Before §176 the connection tracker filtered it out, so the older "won't be there" guidance no longer holds.)

## 3. Local attack surface

Threat: another app on the same device abuses our local proxy or API (the class of vulnerabilities seen in mobile VLESS clients).

| Measure | How we defend | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **TUN-only inbound** | No SOCKS5/HTTP proxy on localhost by default — traffic enters only through TUN | An open local proxy with no auth = any app silently routes through the VPN |
| **Local proxy — auth when non-localhost** | If `proxy_listen` ≠ `127.x` (reachable from the network), auth is forced on | A LAN-reachable proxy with no password is an open relay |
| **No Clash HTTP API** | The Clash API was removed entirely in the §122 CommandClient migration — the core is built without `with_clash_api`, and an `experimental.clash_api` block in a config now causes a **fatal** start failure. Core control goes through the libbox **CommandClient**, an in-process command channel with **no network socket** at all | An open localhost API is the classic mobile-VLESS vulnerability; with no HTTP surface there is nothing to scan or brute-force |
| **Debug API — opt-in, off by default** | The local HTTP Debug API (subscription/rule/settings CRUD, `PUT /config`) does not run unless the user turns it on (`debug_enabled` default `false`); an empty Bearer token also keeps the server down | No local HTTP attack surface exists in the default install |
| **Debug API — loopback + Bearer + Host check** | Bound to `127.0.0.1` only (default port `9269`). Every endpoint except `/ping` and `/help` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (fail-closed on an empty token). A Host-header check rejects anything but `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` (anti-DNS-rebinding), so a rebinded `evil.com` gets `403` even if the token leaked | A LAN-reachable or CSRF-style path to full config control would be catastrophic; see [`debug-api-reference.md`](api/debug-api-reference.md) and spec §031 |
| **pprof server — on-demand, loopback-only, no auth** | The §207 goroutine/CPU capture raises a libbox `PProfServer` on `127.0.0.1` (ports 6060–6065) only for the duration of a user-initiated capture, then tears it down. `network_security_config` permits cleartext HTTP **only** to loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`); all external traffic stays cleartext-forbidden | Diagnostics must not open a persistent unauthenticated port, and the cleartext exemption must stay loopback-scoped; see spec §207 |
| **Automation receivers — exported but disabled** | The §047/§157 automation receiver and Locale-plugin components are declared `android:exported="true"` but `android:enabled="false"`, so they are inert until the user flips the master "accept automation commands" toggle | Off by default means no third-party app can drive the client out of the box |
| **VpnService / BootReceiver not exported** | `android:exported="false"` | Third-party apps can't invoke our core service components |

Source and roadmap — [`020 — Security & DPI Bypass`](spec/tasks/020F-security-and-dpi-bypass/spec.md).

> **Automation caveat (§157).** Once the automation master toggle is ON, the receiver accepts its control commands from **any** caller on the device — a broadcast carries no caller identity, so there is no per-app authentication (`android:permission` is deliberately unset). The commands are control-only (start/stop/switch node/set group/rebuild/refresh/reset/urltest — no secret-exfiltration path), and outgoing automation events carry status labels only. See the “Security” section of [`AUTOMATION.md`](AUTOMATION.md).

## 4. Secrets on the device

| Secret | How we protect it |
|--------|-------------------|
| **WARP private key** | The X25519 key is generated **on the device** and never leaves it — only the public key is sent to Cloudflare. We don't use third-party generator workers (they hand out a server-generated private key). See [§025 WARP](spec/tasks/025F-warp-integration/spec.md). |
| **MASQUE key & device token** | The §130 MASQUE transport uses a **separate** ECDSA P-256 keypair generated on the device; only the public part is enrolled with Cloudflare (PATCH enroll), the SEC1-DER private key never leaves the phone. The per-device Cloudflare Bearer token is stored locally and is marked never-log alongside the private key. See [§130 MASQUE](spec/tasks/130F-masque-warp-transport/spec.md). |
| **Debug API Bearer token** | Held in settings storage; the Debug API is off by default and bound to loopback only (see §3). |
| **Subscription credentials** | Roadmap: encrypted storage (Android Keystore), URL masking in the UI — see the roadmap in spec 020. A §129 file-based subscription additionally persists its imported body as a plaintext `HttpCache` snapshot (keyed `file:<uuid>`) in the app's private storage; the same encrypted-storage roadmap item covers these snapshots. |

## 5. Summary table

| Mechanism | Axis / layer | What it catches | Apps affected? |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `0.0.0.0/0 → reject` | WHERE (destination IP) | all IPv4 traffic indiscriminately | yes, all |
| `final = reject` | fallback | everything that matched no rule above | yes, unless explicitly described |
| **Unknown traffic** (`block_unknown`) | WHO (socket owner) | traffic with an empty package (`INVALID_UID`) | **no** — ownerless only |
| No Clash HTTP API (CommandClient) | local surface | in-process control, no network socket to attack | — |
| Debug API off by default; loopback + Bearer + Host check | local surface | unauthorized config control (opt-in only) | — |
| TUN-only / auth-on-LAN | local surface | other apps using the local proxy | — |
| On-device key gen (WARP X25519, MASQUE P-256) | secrets | private-key leakage | — |

**Key takeaway:** ownerless traffic = entered tun bypassing the VpnService intercept (`curl --interface tun0`, termux bind), the UID doesn't resolve → the package is empty → it's caught **only** by the "Unknown traffic" rule, not by destination rules like `0.0.0.0/0`. So full leak protection needs both axes.
