# Template language — typed variables, conditions and per-node repetition

The template language turns variables, `#if` conditions and `for_each` repetition over nodes into
concrete sing-box JSON; the declared type decides how each value is written.

## What it does

Turns a declarative template with variables and conditions into concrete
JSON. There is one markup rule: `#` is an engine keyword, `@` is a reference to a
variable, everything else is data. The language standard is shared with the launcher
(see Documentation below).

## Parameters

**Variable types and coercion:**

| `type` | Into the config | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `bool` | `true` if the value after trim, case-insensitive, = `true`, otherwise `false` | |
| `int` | a number clamped to 0..65535; not a number — as a string + `template_int_invalid` | outside 0..65535 — `template_int_clamped` |
| `text_list` | an array of strings: line by line, trimmed, empty ones dropped | |
| `text`, `secret`, `enum`, `outbound`, `dns_servers` | a string verbatim | `options` do not affect coercion |
| undeclared | a string verbatim | legacy values |

A variable's value: the user's record, otherwise `default_value`. Empty
with `required` and a non-empty default → the default (not for `secret`).
A variable with bounds (`dns_cache_capacity` 1024..65535): out of bounds —
the default.

**Constructs:**

| Construct | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"@name"` (the whole string) | substitution of the typed value; inside a string `@` is a literal |
| `{"#tpl": "@{node}-dns"}` | a composite string; empty or unknown → the node is removed |
| `"#if…": {"#and"\|"#or": […], "#value": …, "#else": …}` | as an object key — the branch's fields merge into the object; as the only key of an array element — the element is replaced by the branch or drops out |
| `"#enable": <condition>` | the node exists only if the condition is true; the contents are not evaluated |
| `"#on_change": {"#set": {"@x": …}}` | when the variable is toggled, write derived values once |
| `{"ref": "<global>"}` in a preset's `vars` | a variable by reference to a global one |
| `for_each: {node_type, as, filter}` on a preset | the body is repeated for each matching node; `@node`, `@node.skip_presets`, `@node.body.<path>` |

Predicates: `"@v"` (bool), `{"@v": "literal"}`, `{"@v": "#notEmpty"|"#isEmpty"}`,
`{"@v": {"#in"|"#notIn": […]}}`, `{"@v": {"#matches": "re"}}`,
`{"#not": …}`; conditions nest to any depth. Legacy spellings without `#`
(`and`, `value`, `enabled: "@var"`) are read indefinitely.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** a template fragment (the skeleton, a preset body, a template DNS
server body), variable values, for `for_each` — the nodes of the final config.
**Outputs:** a JSON fragment; engine warnings with a code and parameters
(`template_var_undeclared`, `template_unknown_directive`,
`template_int_clamped`, `template_int_invalid`, `template_fragment_dropped`),
without duplicates by the "code + parameters" pair.

## Rules and invariants

- The branch is chosen before the walk; the discarded branch is not evaluated and yields no
  warnings. Several `#if` on one object are distinguished by a suffix
  (`#if1`, `#if tun-only`) and applied in sorted order.
- An `#if` branch of an array element that is itself an array is merged into the
  parent one level up.
- At runtime an undeclared `@name` stays a literal, an unknown
  neighbouring `#` directive is removed — both with a warning. At load the same
  errors in the shipped template reject the template.
- Template warnings go first in the build report, are shown as a snackbar
  with an expandable list and do not block saving the config.
- A ref variable has no metadata or value of its own: the type, options and
  value are taken from the global one; in the rule editor it is shown with the
  global's metadata, an edit writes to the global. A copy in the preset
  record is ignored and cleaned out.
- In records of template DNS servers and presets a value equal to the default
  is not stored; an undeclared name is removed (`outbound` is legitimate on any
  preset as a universal target override).
- `on_change` is a one-time effect at the moment of toggling, not a lock: the target can
  be overridden by hand. Example: `ipv6_enabled` sets `dns_strategy` and
  `resolve_strategy` to `prefer_ipv4` / `ipv4_only`. The preset pseudo-variables
  `@rule_enable` / `@dns_enable` recompute global targets when
  the preset and its DNS part are enabled (FakeIP turns off `resolve_enabled`).
- `for_each` serves only nodes that got into the final config, in config
  order; the tags of such presets have no preset prefix (`<node>-dns`).
- `@runtime.platform/arch/target` are declared without a value on the phone: the key
  or element drops out, in a condition — false.

## Boundaries

- How a preset is declared with these constructs — [preset language and
  catalog](preset-bundles.md); what exactly is gated by variables in presets
  and DNS — [004-ROUTING](../../004-ROUTING/FEATURE.md), [005-DNS](../../005-DNS/FEATURE.md).
- The UI for multi-select and free input for `options_open` — not finished (§555 follow-up).

## Documentation

- The normative description of the template language (keywords, variable
  types, coercion rules, `#if` / `for_each` / `#tpl` semantics) is
  `contract/docs/TEMPLATE_LANG.md` in the launcher repository
  ([Leadaxe/singbox-launcher](https://github.com/Leadaxe/singbox-launcher)),
  together with the shared corpus `contract/corpus/template/`. The app pulls a
  copy into `app/contract/` with `app/tool/sync_contract.sh`; that copy is not
  committed, so there is no in-repo link.
- The full schema of the shipped template (`wizard_template.json`: sections,
  presets, variables, DNS catalogue) is [`docs/TEMPLATE.md`](../../../../TEMPLATE.md).
