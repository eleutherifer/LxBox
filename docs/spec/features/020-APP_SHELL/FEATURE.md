## Purpose

Everything that surrounds the VPN but is not the VPN: how the app looks, which
language it speaks, how to navigate it, what it asks on first launch, how it
announces a new version and how it asks to support the author. Domain settings
(tunnel, subscriptions, diagnostics, automation) are not described here — the
feature gives them a home (the App Settings screen, the side menu) and shared
conventions.

The feature protects four principles:

- **No consent — not a single "phone home" request.** The update check and the
  message feed go to the network only after an explicit "yes" on first launch
  or after the toggle is turned on; until then the app lives on built-in data.
- **The shell does not get in the way.** The new version notice appears only at
  launch, the support request — at most once per launch and only to someone who
  has been using the VPN for a long time; vibration — only on significant
  events; an accidental "back" does not throw the user out of the app.
- **Language is for humans, English is for machines.** The interface, system
  surfaces and template texts are translated; logs, the Debug API, automation
  events and config values are always English.
- **A setting applies immediately.** Shell toggles are saved at the moment of
  change and take effect without a restart; there is no "Save" button.

## Promises

- **P1. The theme follows the choice and applies immediately.** System / Light /
  Dark, System by default (follows the device theme); a change repaints the
  whole app without a restart and survives a restart. **Witness:** manual check —
  App Settings → Appearance → Dark, close and reopen the app. **Mutation:** the
  theme is read only at startup.
- **P2. Portrait by default, rotation by consent.** Without "Allow rotation" the
  interface is locked to portrait; turning it on immediately hands the
  orientation to the system auto-rotate (and its lock). **Witness:** manual check
  on a tablet. **Mutation:** rotation allowed by default.
- **P3. Two columns of the node list — from 600 dp and only with the toggle on.**
  Manual sort is always single-column. **Witness:** units "599 dp — одна
  колонка", "600 dp — две колонки (порог нестрогий)", "§541 тумблер выключен —
  одна колонка на любой ширине", "ручная сортировка остаётся одноколоночной".
  **Mutation:** a strict `> 600` threshold.
- **P4. Vibration — only on the listed events and at most once per 100 ms.** A
  disabled toggle silences all events at once, without a restart. **Witness:**
  units "enabled=false → no platform calls", "throttle blocks rapid duplicate
  fires", "toggling enabled mid-flight applies immediately". **Mutation:**
  throttling removed.
- **P5. The language is chosen from System / English / Русский / 中文; an unknown
  value is System.** System takes the device language, and if it is not
  supported — English. **Witness:** units "set() with unknown value falls back to
  system", "invalid stored value resolves to system". **Mutation:** an unknown
  device language gives an empty locale.
- **P6. Changing the language — without a restart; the first frame is already
  in the right language.** **Witness:** units "смена языка сохраняет выбор,
  прогревает шаблон, подменяет словарь и перерисовывает", "холодный старт
  прогревает словарь — первый кадр локализован". **Mutation:** the dictionary
  is loaded after the first frame.
- **P7. Untranslated means English, not empty and not a format string.** No
  dictionary, key or form — the English text is shown with the values
  substituted; a missing argument is an empty spot, not `%s`. **Witness:** units
  "missing key → key itself substituted", "missing arg → empty placeholder",
  ".s never throws on plural-object value → key fallback". **Mutation:** a
  missing argument prints `%s`.
- **P8. Machine surfaces are English in any language.** **Witness:** unit
  "renderWith(ru) русеет, renderEn() неизменен". **Mutation:** the log writes a
  message in the interface language.
- **P9. The language from Android system settings and the in-app language do
  not conflict.** A change in the app's system settings wins; a change in
  storage (restoring a backup, Debug API) also wins if the system did not
  change. **Witness:** reconciliation branch units "системные Settings поменяли
  язык → система побеждает", "restore/Debug API поменял сторадж → сторадж
  побеждает". **Mutation:** a one-sided "the system is always right".
- **P10. The language survives a backup.** **Witness:** unit "app_language
  export → import round-trip preserves value". **Mutation:** the language key
  dropped from the import allowlist.
- **P11. First launch — questions one at a time and once each.** Notification
  permission → background activity → Quick Settings tile → update check; the
  next question appears after the previous one is answered; the answer is
  remembered, including on a full settings replacement from a backup.
  **Witness:** unit "replaceRaw merge=false keeps startup prompt flags"; the
  order — manual check on a clean install. **Mutation:** the questions are
  launched in parallel.
- **P12. Before consent the app does not ask GitHub about releases and the
  feed.** The update check is off by default; without consent the feed is read
  from the cache or the built-in copy. **Witness:** units "§422: без согласия на
  обновления — ни одного запроса, читаем кэш", "без согласия и без кэша —
  bundled-копия, сеть не трогается"; for the update check — `no witness`.
  **Mutation:** the update check default is `true`.
- **P13. Auto-check — at most once a day, dev builds stay silent, "Check now"
  always works.** **Witness:** `no witness`. **Mutation:** the daily threshold is
  counted from a failed attempt.
- **P14. The new version notice — only at launch and only from the stored
  result.** The result of a network check appears on the next launch; the
  notice does not pop up over the running app. **Witness:** manual check —
  "Check now" with a new version available does not raise the popup, a restart
  does. **Mutation:** showing on arrival of the network response.
- **P15. "Later" — until the next launch, "Ignore" — forever for this version, a
  tap — to its own store without remembering.** The next version is shown
  again. **Witness:** widget tests "«Later» не персистит", "«Ignore» персистит
  тег", "уже проигнорированную версию не показываем", "клик по телу: переход в
  стор, но БЕЗ персиста". **Mutation:** "Later" remembers the version.
- **P16. The update link leads to where the app was installed from.** GitHub —
  the release page, Google Play — the store listing, F-Droid — the package
  page. **Witness:** widget tests "github-канал ведёт на страницу релиза",
  "f-droid ведёт на страницу пакета"; install channel units ("Obtainium ставит
  APK с GitHub → github"). **Mutation:** all channels → GitHub.
- **P17. Version comparison is strict; garbage does not wake it.** **Witness:**
  units "equal returns false", "malformed input returns false (no
  false-positive notify)". **Mutation:** string comparison.
- **P18. The support request — only to someone who uses the VPN right now and
  has used it for a long time.** Shown with the tunnel connected, with a
  session no shorter than the threshold and accumulated uptime no less than
  the threshold since the last baseline; the queue is strict. **Witness:** units
  "session-gate: VPN не активен / короткая сессия → null", "baseline: порог
  считается от точки отсчёта", "очередь строгая". **Mutation:** the uptime
  threshold counted from zero.
- **P19. After an app update the feed does not dump everything at once.** A
  version change moves the baseline; the update itself does not mark read
  messages as unread. **Witness:** units "смена версии приложения сдвигает
  baseline", "обновление приложения САМО не распрочитывает". **Mutation:**
  counting from the first launch.
- **P20. "Later" silences the whole feed for hours of uptime; "Got it" cannot be
  pressed blindly.** **Witness:** units "snooze поднимает порог от текущего
  total", widget test "таймер: «Got it (N)» disabled → тикает → активна".
  **Mutation:** snooze in calendar hours.
- **P21. Message buttons do nothing dangerous on their own.** An unknown action
  is hidden; `add:` only fills the input field; `share:` does not close the
  message. **Witness:** units "route: неизвестный экран … → false", "share:
  непустой payload резолвится и НЕ уводит с экрана"; widget test "кнопки: https
  видна; будущее действие скрыто". **Mutation:** `add:` adds the node right away.
- **P22. Exit — by a double "back".** On the home screen the first "back" shows
  a hint, the second within 2 s exits; an open menu is closed without a hint.
  **Witness:** widget tests "первое нажатие: сообщение, выхода нет", "второе
  нажатие в пределах 2 секунд: выход", "второе после 2 секунд: снова
  сообщение", "открыто боковое меню". **Mutation:** a window with no time limit.
- **P23. App Settings toggles are saved immediately.** **Witness:** manual check —
  toggle, kill the process, open. **Mutation:** writing on a button press.

## Controlled parameters

| Setting | Where | Values | Default | When it takes effect |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Theme | App Settings → Appearance | System / Light / Dark | System | immediately |
| Allow rotation | same place, Layout | on/off | off (portrait) | immediately |
| Two columns on wide screens | same place, Layout | on/off | on | immediately |
| Language | same place | System default / English / Русский / 中文（简体） | System default | immediately |
| Haptic feedback | App Settings → General → Feedback | on/off | on | immediately |
| Check for updates on launch | App Settings → General → Updates | on/off | off until the first-launch question is answered | from the next launch |
| Check now | same place and About | button | — | immediately |

Fixed values: double "back" window — 2 s; two-column threshold — 600 dp;
vibration throttling — 100 ms; auto-check interval — 24 h, first attempt — 5 s
after the home screen opens; request timeout — 10 s; version popup — 6 s.

The feature emits no core config keys.

Formats: the latest version manifest (`tag`, `name`, `html_url`,
`published_at`); the message feed (`snooze_active_hours`, `messages[]` with `id`,
`since_version`, `skip`, `min_active_hours`, `min_session_minutes`,
`read_delay_seconds`, `i18n.<language>.{title, message, links[]}`); links
`lxbox://route:<screen>[/<tab>]`, `lxbox://add:<link>`,
`lxbox://share:<text>`; translation dictionaries — English text → translation.

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** touches and "back"; the device language and theme; the app language
from system settings (Android 13+); the install channel; GitHub responses about
the latest release and the message feed; tunnel uptime and the current session
duration; tunnel events and subscription updates (for vibration).

**Outputs:** interface theme and layout; the language of the interface, system
notifications, the tile and shortcuts; vibration; first-launch questions; the
new version popup and the block in About; the full-screen feed message; the
"new version available" automation event (if enabled in 014).

## Data flow

```
language: setting | device language | system settings → reconciliation → dictionary
      → interface · template · system surfaces; machine surfaces → English
first launch: notifications → background activity → tile → update consent
updates: [consent] 5 s after home → releases API ─ failure → own manifest
      → version cache → (next launch) popup Later / Ignore / tap → channel's store
feed: [consent] network → cache → built-in copy → queue → gates (session,
      uptime since baseline, snooze) → full-screen message → Got it / Later / X
tunnel and subscription events → toggle → throttling → vibration
```

## Rules and guarantees

- One consent on first launch controls two network channels: the release
  check and the message feed update.
- Dismissing the update check question with the system "back" is a choice by
  install channel: from a store — off, otherwise — on.
- A dismissed version is shown neither at launch nor from the cache; About
  still shows the known new version.
- The feed is loaded once per process and shows at most one message per
  launch; "X" closes a message without marking it — it will come again on the
  next launch.
- The theme is a device property: it is not part of the backup or of settings
  sets (018). Language, vibration, rotation, columns and update consent are.

## Boundaries

- Tunnel settings, auto-start, modes — [010-VPN_SERVICE](../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md);
  tile, shortcuts and Intent API — [014-AUTOMATION](../014-AUTOMATION/FEATURE.md);
  the Diagnostics tab — [013-DIAGNOSTICS](../013-DIAGNOSTICS/FEATURE.md);

  usage region — [015-WARP](../015-WARP/FEATURE.md); backup —
  017; settings sets — 018.
- There is no in-app update installation: only a link.
- The message feed cannot be turned off entirely; it can be snoozed or read.
- Donations — About → "Support the project"; the addresses come as a separate
  list on an explicit action (public document `docs/DONATE.md`).
- RTL languages are not supported.
- Depends on OS capabilities: the vibration motor and the system "Touch
  feedback"; choosing the app language in system settings (Android 13+);
  requesting the tile through a system dialog (Android 13+); notification
  permission (Android 13+); battery optimization exemption and third-party
  vendor restrictors; the predictive "back" gesture.

- [010-VPN_SERVICE](../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md) — tunnel settings, auto-start and modes live there; the VPN permission is requested on the first connection; tunnel events drive vibration and the support feed gates.
- [014-AUTOMATION](../014-AUTOMATION/FEATURE.md) — the tile, shortcuts and Intent API; the "new version available" automation event; the tile step of first launch.
- [013-DIAGNOSTICS](../013-DIAGNOSTICS/FEATURE.md) — the Diagnostics tab of App Settings (System setup, logs, Developer) and the Debug API.
- [001-SUBSCRIPTIONS](../001-SUBSCRIPTIONS/FEATURE.md) — the Subscriptions tab of App Settings; subscription updates drive vibration.
- [015-WARP](../015-WARP/FEATURE.md) — the Region section on the General tab.
- [017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE](../017-BACKUP_AND_STORAGE/FEATURE.md) — language, vibration, rotation, columns and update consent are part of the backup; the theme is not; first-launch prompt flags survive a full replacement.
- [018-WORKSPACES](../018-WORKSPACES/FEATURE.md) — shell settings except the theme belong to the set; loading a set applies its language; the set menu sits in the home screen header.
- [003-CONFIG_BUILD](../003-CONFIG_BUILD/FEATURE.md) — automatic VPN restart on settings change in the Behavior section; the build sees an edit already on returning home.
- [009-NODE_HEALTH](../009-NODE_HEALTH/FEATURE.md) — auto-ping after connecting in the Feedback section.
- [007-NODE_LIST](../007-NODE_LIST/FEATURE.md), [008-NODE_EDITOR](../008-NODE_EDITOR/FEATURE.md) — the empty home screen prompting to add a server replaces a setup wizard in first launch.

## Maintenance notes

- F-Droid catalogs treat a background request to GitHub without consent as
  tracking (the Tracking anti-feature): any new network channel of the shell
  must sit behind the same consent (§395, §422).
- The anonymous GitHub API limit (60 requests per hour per address) is
  exhausted by the shared VPN exit address: without our own manifest the check
  would silently fail.
- A new language is added with an interface dictionary, a template dictionary
  and system surface strings; the CI translation checks are strict — an
  untranslated or orphaned string breaks the build (procedure — `docs/l10n.md`).
- A string rendered outside the localizer stays English in any language and is
  not caught by the check if it reaches the text through a variable.
