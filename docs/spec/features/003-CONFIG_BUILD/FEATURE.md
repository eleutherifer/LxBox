# Config build — turning nodes and settings into a validated sing-box config

LxBox builds the sing-box core config from your nodes, routing presets, DNS and VPN settings, so you
never write JSON by hand. A template shipped with the app, with typed variables and conditions,
defines the structure; a fixed pipeline of stages adds nodes, groups, rules and DNS, repairs what
can be repaired and rejects a config the core would not start. The app tracks when the config is
stale, rebuilds it automatically and shows a restart banner only when the running VPN actually uses
a different config.

| Field | Value |
|------|----------|
| Feature | 003-CONFIG_BUILD |
| Type | Product feature |
| Absorbed | `§076F` (settings and config lifecycle: the staleness flag, banners, rebuild on return), `§120F` (template engine: typed variables, `#if`, ref variables — its functions now live in 024-TEMPLATE) |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## Purpose

The user does not write JSON for the core. They pick nodes, enable presets,
flip toggles — and the app turns this into one sing-box config. The feature
owns the transformation itself: the pipeline of stages that assembles nodes,
groups, rules and DNS into a whole; the check of the result before start; and
the lifecycle "changed a setting → config rebuilt → core on the new config".
The template the pipeline starts from, and the language it is written in, are
[024-TEMPLATE](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md).

Three principles the feature protects:

1. **A config the core will not accept is not saved and never reaches the core.**
   What can be fixed by degradation is fixed with a warning; what cannot is
   fatal with a clear reason, and the previous config stays on disk.
2. **A setting edit is not lost.** The change is visible to the next build immediately,
   the "config is stale" flag is cleared only on a successful build and survives
   the process being killed.
3. **The banner does not lie.** "Config changed" is shown only when the core
   is actually running a different config; false banners are a defect.

## Promises

- **P1.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P1](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P2.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P2](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P3.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P3](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P4.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P4](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P5.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P5](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P6.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P6](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P7.** moved to [024-TEMPLATE · P7](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#promises)
- **P8. The fixable is fixed by degradation before the check.** A dangling detour, a ghost
  group member, `route.final` to a vanished Direction (→ `vpn-1`),
  `resolve` to a missing DNS server, an unknown uTLS fingerprint (→
  `chrome`), a broken REALITY — are removed/replaced with a warning.
  **Witness:** unit tests "several broken detours → all removed, the valid one survived",
  "resolve referencing a missing server → server removed", "a garbage
  fingerprint → chrome with a record", "an odd short_id cleared, the node and config
  are alive". **Mutation:** keep the reference — a core fatal at start.
- **P9. The unfixable is fatal; the config is not saved.** A dangling rule reference,
  `route.final`, detour, `dns.final`/resolver; an empty urltest; a selector `default`
  outside its members; a detour/group ring. **Witness:** unit tests "a dangling
  rule reference → fatal", "a ring via a selector node→group→node — one
  culprit"; "not saved" — manual: build a detour ring → Start →
  a sheet with the culprits, the VPN does not start. **Mutation:** return JSON on fatal.
- **P10. An edit is visible to the next build immediately.** A mutation on a settings screen
  goes into the in-memory store right away; the disk write — on leaving the screen
  or minimizing. **Witness:** unit tests "staged rules are visible to a reader before
  the disk write", "an edit immediately raises the flag and is staged in memory".
  **Mutation:** give the build the state only after the disk write.
- **P11. The "config is stale" flag is neither lost nor set without reason.** It is cleared
  only on a successful build; a mutation during a build keeps it; a disk
  write after the build does not re-raise it; a failed or empty subscription fetch
  does not set it. **Witness:** unit tests "toggling a subscription during
  a build does not lose the flag", "the write on leaving the screen does not re-raise the flag
  after a rebuild", "fetch failures do not raise the flag", "the same composition
  again — the flag is not raised". **Mutation:** clear the flag at the start of the build.
- **P12. Staleness survives the process being killed.** At launch the flag is
  restored by comparing the modification times of the settings and the config (with
  one-second precision) and the config is silently rebuilt. **Witness:** unit tests
  "a fresh config in the native part's directory → not stale", "a settings write
  with the flag raised does not touch the config (honestly stale)", "edit → flag
  cleared by a rebuild → write → clean". **Mutation:** look for the config in the wrong directory
  (§414) — a perpetual "dirty".
- **P13. The VPN starts on the current config.** There are unwritten changes
  or a build in progress — Start first awaits/does a rebuild (one for
  all triggers). **Witness:** no autotest — manual: edit a rule → immediately
  Start → in the log "Config built" comes before the core start.
- **P14. The banners are mutually exclusive.** The blue "Settings changed — tap to
  rebuild config" — the flag is raised and no build is running; "Config changed — restart
  VPN to apply" — the tunnel is up, the flag is cleared, the saved config diverged from
  the running one, and no auto-apply is in progress. **Witness:** unit tests "flag raised, but
  a build is running — no banner", "restart is not shown with the flag raised",
  "restart is not shown with the tunnel off", "restart is suppressed for the
  auto-apply window". **Mutation:** both banners at once.
- **P15. "Restart" does not appear if the core is already on this config.**
  The saved config is compared with the running one in the core's canonical form;
  no answer — the banner stays (an extra one is better than a missed one). **Witness:** unit tests
  "forms matched → fresh", "no snapshot of the running one → unknown, not
  fresh".
  **Mutation:** compare the file bytes with the previous build.
- **P16. Auto-restart — only when there is something to apply.** Checkbox on,
  tunnel up, the config diverged from the running one, the rebuild succeeded, not in
  cooldown. **Witness:** unit tests "all conditions met → restart", "tunnel
  down → no", "the core is already on this config → no", "cooldown → skip,
  the banner stays as the fallback path". **Mutation:** restart on every build.
- **P17. Selecting a member of an own group is applied live.** The core switches
  immediately, no banner; the choice is saved and gets into the config on the next
  start. **Witness:** unit test "live selection: the state is written, the config awaits a
  rebuild at start". **Mutation:** raise the staleness flag.

Immutable keys of the template skeleton: `log.timestamp: true`,
`route.find_process: true`, `outbounds` `direct-out` and `block`,
`experimental.cache_file` (`enabled`, `path: cache.db`, `store_fakeip`),
`services: [{type: oom-killer}]`. Variables of the DNS, VPN Mode, TLS
Fragmentation, Auto Proxy and preset sections live in their own features (see Boundaries).

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** the shipped template (variable sections, the `config` skeleton,
the preset catalog, group templates, the DNS catalog) with an overlay of locale display
texts; the user's variable values; node sources;
Directions and chains; rules and preset records; DNS records; VPN mode,
split tunneling, tunnel sleep parameters; the core version and its build tags;
a snapshot of the core's running config.

**Outputs:** the final JSON for the core (saved only without a fatal);
build warnings (template codes first, then degradations); fatal
reasons; values the build fixed itself and asks to save
(DNS resolver defaults); the "final tag → source node" map;
banners on the main screen, the snackbar "Config rebuilt: N nodes".

## Rules and guarantees

- Variable metadata (type, default, options) comes only from the template;
  storage holds only the value. A value equal to the default is not stored in preset
  records and template DNS servers.
- The build is a single point: all paths (return to main, the banner, Start,
  launch, subscription reaction, Debug API) go through it and share one current
  rebuild.
- The "stale" flag is one per process and is not stored on disk; at launch it is
  derived from file modification times.
- If the config is pinned via the Debug API (`PUT /config`), rebuilds
  silently do not happen — see [019-CONFIG_EDITOR](../019-CONFIG_EDITOR/FEATURE.md).
- Settings outside the config (haptic feedback, language) do not raise the flag.

  rejected by the core at start — [009-NODE_HEALTH](../009-NODE_HEALTH/FEATURE.md).
- Manual editing of the final JSON — [019-CONFIG_EDITOR](../019-CONFIG_EDITOR/FEATURE.md);
  loading a set of settings — [018-WORKSPACES](../018-WORKSPACES/FEATURE.md).
- Native tunnel settings (Allow bypass, Keep on exit, Background mode)
  are not part of the config and are applied on the next tunnel bring-up — depends
  on OS capabilities.

## Maintenance notes

- Template pitfalls (the two documents to keep in step, `#if` suffixes, `on_change`
  pseudo-variables) — [024-TEMPLATE](../024-TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md#maintenance-notes).
- A screen that saves on leaving must put the edit into memory immediately:
  return to main fires at the moment of pop, and the screen's leave — ~300 ms
  later; otherwise the config lags one visit behind (§107).
- The "stale" flag may be cleared only on the result of a build and only if the composition
  did not change under it (§360); re-staging an edit on leaving the screen
  must not set the flag again (§338).
- The config modification time is aligned to the settings time, not to "now":
  the one-second precision of the file system otherwise gives a false "dirty" (§113).
- `reject` in a preset's `outbound` is not a tag: the build itself turns it into
  `action: reject`, otherwise it is a dangling reference.
