# DNS query trace — who asked, what was answered and why it failed

The trace is part of the profiler log and is recorded only while recording is
on.

## What it does

While the profiler is recording, shows every DNS query of the device: who
asked, what was asked, what was answered (with the CNAME chain), which server
and through which channel answered, whether the answer came from the cache,
and for DNS groups — whom they polled and how it ended. Notices when DNS fails
to resolve en masse while the link is alive, and suggests what to do.

## Parameters

No settings of its own; works while the profiler is recording
([recording](recording.md)).

## Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:** the core's `CommandDNS` stream — domain, query type, rcode, TTL,
answer source (`exchanged` / `cached` / `optimistic` / `refreshed` / `rejected`
/ `failed`), failure flag and reason, owner, DNS server and its type, the
server's channel, answers, group path, probes (`answered` / `timeout` /
`network_error` / `servfail` + RTT), fan-out and survival flags.

**Outputs:** `dnsResolve` / `dnsFail` events in the log; in the details —
server, server type, source, answer, group path, probes, fan-out, survival; a
`cached` badge in the row; the banner "N% of DNS queries failing while the
connection is alive — tap to fix" and the sheet "DNS queries are failing" with
the buttons "Open DNS settings", "Enable FakeIP", "Close".

## Rules and invariants

- The event domain is the one the app asked for; CNAME targets — as a separate
  chain; IP — the first A/AAAA address of the answer; for non-address answers
  the value goes into "answer". The core's answer arrives as a full record
  string — the value is taken.
- Query type — the record name (A, AAAA, CNAME, HTTPS, SVCB, SOA…); an unknown
  code — `TYPE<N>`; events are not lost because of a rare type.
- Failure is determined by the core's failure flag: some failures arrive with a
  real response code. Reason — the core text, otherwise "no response" (rcode
  `-1` — there was no reply at all), otherwise "rcode N". A failure event
  carries ⚠ "DNS exchange failed: …" and the group trace.
- The server channel is the selected node (the selector is unrolled by the
  core); empty — direct or an answer from the cache.
- Owner — from the core; no owner — "no owner", only a failure counts as an
  alarm (see [attribution](attribution.md)).
- The group trace is written only for queries through a DNS group, the fan-out
  and survival flags — only when true; on a cache hit there are no probes; late
  fan-out answers do not enter the trace.
- **DNS health.** A sliding 30 s window over the log: "degradation" if there
  are ≥ 3 failures, their share is ≥ 20 % and there were connections within the
  window. Without connections (idle) — silence. Failures older than the window
  are not counted.

## Boundaries

- DNS queries hijacked by the core do not get into connections — only here.
- Without profiler recording DNS events are not collected and the detector is
  silent.
- The full state of DNS groups, DNS and FakeIP settings —
  [005-DNS](../../005-DNS/FEATURE.md); the sheet only leads there.
- The core keeps no history: the stream starts from the moment of subscription.
