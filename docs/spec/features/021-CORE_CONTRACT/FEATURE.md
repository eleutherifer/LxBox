# FEATURE 021 — CORE_CONTRACT — the boundary with the core and the shared contract

| Field | Value |
|------|----------|
| Type | Process feature (ongoing work on the boundary with the core and the launcher) |
| Absorbed | `§121F` (+ `§122F` as the explanation of the Clash API removal) |
| Core | [Leadaxe/sing-box-lx](https://github.com/Leadaxe/sing-box-lx), branch `lx`; pin **`v1.14.2-lx.8`** (base — sing-box `1.14.2` + 15 commits of `stable`) |
| Contract | launcher contract registry **`1.1.99`**, copy verified by hash `388251fc…` (synced 2026-09-27) |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-29 · living watchlist |

L×Box carries no VPN engine of its own: everything that goes into the tunnel is
executed by the sing-box-lx core, and everything the app understands in links
and node bodies is described in a contract shared with the desktop launcher.
This feature is about keeping both boundaries moving **explicitly**: the core
is bumped by a ritual, the contract arrives by sync, and divergence is caught
by a test, not by a user.

## Principles it protects

1. **One core version for everyone.** The core pin is one file, read by the
   local build, by CI and by F-Droid. A smoke test on a version other than the
   pin does not count.
2. **The core is stricter than the client, the client is more visible than the
   core.** The core decodes the config strictly: one unknown field takes down
   the **whole** config, not one node. So the client never emits what the core
   does not know and shows a ⚠️, while the core is insurance in case the client
   misses something (defence in depth).
3. **Contract before code.** Everything both LxBox and the launcher see
   (protocol dictionaries, allowlists, warning codes, limits, template
   variables) is described in the contract **before** it is implemented. Code
   is fitted to the corpus fixtures, not the fixtures to the code. A deliberate
   difference is a per-app override with a link to the decision; an orphan
   override is an error.
4. **The core is not patched from the app.** A core bug is feedback to the core
   team, not a patch in the client; a local workaround in the client is allowed
   only as visible protection (dropping a field with a code), not as a silent
   "fixed it for the core".

## Registry: versions and where they live

| What | Value | Where |
|-----|----------|-----|
| Core pin | `v1.14.2-lx.8` | `app/android/libbox.version` — the single source |
| AAR delivery | the fork's GitHub Releases: `libbox-<ver>.aar` + `SHA256SUMS`, hash check; the AAR is not in git | `scripts/fetch-libbox.sh`; CI — the "Fetch sing-box-lx core" step in the `android` job |
| AAR build tags | `with_gvisor, with_quic, with_wireguard, with_utls, with_naive_outbound, with_xhttp, with_awg, with_lx_command, with_lx_idle_suspend, with_lx_chain, with_openvpn, with_openconnect, with_tailscale` + `ts_omit_*`; **without** `with_clash_api` | baked into the core; libbox does not export them, the app keeps a mirror of the set with its own pin — the unit "the core tag pin matches `libbox.version`" is red until reconciled |
| Contract registry | `1.1.99` | source — the launcher repo, `contract/`; in the app — the committed registry mirror (ships in the APK); `app/contract/` — the vendored copy (gitignored), `app/contract.lock` — sha256 of the copy |
| Contract documentation | byte-for-byte mirror of `contract/docs/generated/**` | [`docs/contract/`](../../../contract/README.md) — not edited by hand |
| Core control | libbox CommandClient (push streams + unary RPC) | the Clash HTTP API is removed (§122) |

## Registry: what the app hands the core beyond upstream

Keys and RPCs that stock sing-box does not have are a contract with the fork.
The behaviour is described in the neighbouring features; this is the summary,
so that a core bump knows what to check.

| Key / RPC | What | Feature | Condition on the core side |
|------------|-----|------|-------------------------|
| `lx.wg.idle_suspend`, `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable` | WG/AWG tunnel sleep | [010 · P17](../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md#promises) | core ≥ `v1.14.2-lx.1` (before — `route.lx_idle_*`); tag `with_lx_idle_suspend`, without it any `lx.wg.*` kills startup |
| `lx.wg.lazy_build: true`, `lx.wg.build_max` | WG/AWG lazy build and budget | [010-VPN_SERVICE](../010-VPN_SERVICE/FEATURE.md) | written only together with `idle_suspend` |
| not written: `lx.wg.build_overflow`, `lx.masque.idle_timeout`; `lx.naive` | the core default `wait` is fine; WARP MASQUE nodes carry their own `idle_timeout`; `lx.naive` is reserved and rejected | — | — |
| AWG `jc`, `jmin`, `jmax`, `s1`, `s2`, `h1`–`h4`, `ip`, `id`, `ib` | WireGuard obfuscation | [015-WARP](../015-WARP/FEATURE.md), [002-NODE_IMPORT](../002-NODE_IMPORT/FEATURE.md) | the `"lo-hi"` range in `h*` — core ≥ `1.14.0-lx.32` (registry `min_core`) |
| outbound `masque` | WARP over MASQUE | [015-WARP](../015-WARP/FEATURE.md) | — |
| `transport.type: xhttp`, `xmux{}` | XHTTP | [016-DPI_HARDENING](../016-DPI_HARDENING/FEATURE.md) | without `xmux` the core picks `max_connections 3` since `lx.6` |
| VLESS `encryption`, `tls.reality.key_share` | VLESS PQ layer, REALITY hybrid key exchange | [016-DPI_HARDENING](../016-DPI_HARDENING/FEATURE.md) | the `encryption` method name is checked by a registry rule |
| DNS server `type: group` (`servers`, `mode`, `error_ttl`, `win_ttl`) | DNS groups | [005-DNS](../005-DNS/FEATURE.md) | — |
| `balancer{}` on `urltest`, type `chain` | balancer, chains | [006-DETOUR_AND_BALANCE](../006-DETOUR_AND_BALANCE/FEATURE.md) | chains — core ≥ `1.14.0-lx.27-rc.5` |
| endpoint `tailscale`, `openvpn-client` | endpoint nodes | [002-NODE_IMPORT](../002-NODE_IMPORT/FEATURE.md) | `tailscale` — tag `with_tailscale` (since `lx.38`); otherwise the node stays out of the config |
| `urlTestOutbound`, `urlTestGroup`, `setEndpointEnabled`, `endpointState` | measurement, WG/AWG on/off at runtime, endpoint state | [009-NODE_HEALTH](../009-NODE_HEALTH/FEATURE.md) | `setEndpointEnabled` — core ≥ `v1.14.2-lx.4` |
| subscriptions `CommandStatus`, `CommandGroup`, `CommandOutbounds`, `CommandConnections`, `CommandDNS`; `GetRunningConfig`, `SubscribeTailscaleStatus` | live state | [012-LIVE_STATE](../012-LIVE_STATE/FEATURE.md) | — |

The registry gate at build time: a node that needs a build tag or a `min_core`
the current core lacks stays out of the config (`build_tag` +
`on_core_unsupported`, contract 1.1.60) — see
[003-CONFIG_BUILD](../003-CONFIG_BUILD/FEATURE.md).

## How the contract is kept honest

| Guard | What it catches | Where it runs |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| registry sync tests | a dictionary in code diverged from the registry | CI, on the registry mirror, **not skipped** (§486) |
| registry dart-refs guard | a `refs.dart` in a registry record points to a deleted file; stale ones only from an allowlist, the list cleans itself up (§491) | CI |
| contract documentation mirror | a "Learn more" page from the previous contract | CI |
| lock check | the contract copy was edited by hand; the registry mirror ≠ the copy | CI step "Contract lock" (with no copy on CI there is nothing to compare) |
| corpus tests (`contract/corpus/**`) | shared behaviour diverged from the launcher | **local only**: there is no copy on CI, the skip is loud (the skip guard lists the suites) |

A new schema, subscription body shape or template-language construct is added
**together with a fixture** — otherwise the other side learns about it from a user.

## The ritual for accepting a new core version

1. **The core is released as a GitHub Release of the fork.** Before the release
   (an rc chain) the AAR is taken from the fork's CI run artifact and placed by
   hand; the pin is **not committed** — a pin to a non-existent release breaks
   the fetch for everyone and in CI.
2. **Surface delta.** `javap` over `classes.jar` of the old and new AAR; a diff
   of `option/*.go` — new body fields go into the registry on the launcher side
   first, then arrive by sync (`sync_contract.sh --to <sha>`). Without that the
   sanitiser strips the new fields as `unknown_key`: the node works, but
   quietly without them.
3. **Build tags.** Reconcile the AAR tag set, move the pin of the tag mirror.
4. **Bump gotchas** (in detail — [KERNEL.md](../../../KERNEL.md)):
   `with_lx_idle_suspend` and `lx.wg.*`; an unknown field kills the whole
   config; the order of crash-report archiving and file truncation (detection
   of the previous crash stands on it); the VLESS `encryption` method name in
   a registry rule.
5. **Raise the pin → fetch → smoke on a device**: start/stop, CommandClient
   streams, AWG/XHTTP/MASQUE nodes. Check the core version only by
   `core_version` from the Debug API `/device` or the dump — a gomobile binary
   does not show it through `strings`.
6. **CHANGELOG + version history in KERNEL.md.** Rolling back below
   `v1.14.2-lx.1` first requires reverting the emit to `route.lx_idle_*`.

In production — **only the official release AAR**: a local gomobile build is not
byte-reproducible, and the hash from `SHA256SUMS` will not match it.

## Feedback to the core

A core problem is filed as a feedback task: the symptom, what was confirmed on
the client side (the binding is present, the call is regular), the core version
and the device, logcat/dump. The client does not patch the core's behaviour meanwhile.

| Feedback | Gist | Outcome |
|--------|------|------|
| [180-FEEDBACK](../../tasks/180-FEEDBACK-kernel-dns-unimplemented.md) | `SubscribeDNSQueries` → `Unimplemented` on rc.7 | fixed in rc.8 (service-registry key) |
| [180-FEEDBACK-2](../../tasks/180-FEEDBACK-2-kernel-dns-processinfo-empty.md) | `DnsQuery.ProcessInfo` empty on every event | accepted, fix in rc.9 (process lookup before the fast path) |
| [376-FEEDBACK](../../tasks/376-FEEDBACK-kernel-urltest-goroutines-survive-restart.md) | a URLTest run survives a core restart and leaks goroutines | — |
| [120](../../tasks/120-upstream-bugreport-default-network-vpn.md) | the `defaultNetwork` seed can be our own VPN (upstream client) | PR to SagerNet/sing-box-for-android#61; here — §119 |

The counter-channel goes to the launcher: missing corpus expectations and
registry divergences (for example, [529](../../tasks/529-contract-corpus-local-reds-triage.md)).

## Forbidden

- Editing the core "from the app" and shipping local builds of it in a release.
- Hand-editing the vendored contract copy, the registry mirror in the app and
  `docs/contract/` — they only arrive by sync.
- Bringing back the Clash API: `experimental.clash_api` in the config is a fatal
  start error, and `with_clash_api` is deliberately absent from the AAR (§122:
  the data contract moved from pull snapshots to CommandClient push deltas with
  a single cancellation).
- Committing a pin to a version that is not in the fork's Releases.

## Watch for

- **Bumps `v1.14.2-lx.5…lx.8` without a task of their own.** They are in
  KERNEL.md and CHANGELOG, but not in `tasks/` — this feature has no revision for them.
- **The corpus does not run on CI.** Red in the corpus is visible only locally
  (529: URI −6, bodies −27); green registry tests on CI do not cancel that.
- **The build-tag mirror** in the app is a manual copy; the guard checks only
  the version pin, not the set itself.
- **Double readings of the tags in KERNEL.md:** `with_openvpn`/`with_openconnect`
  are in the AAR tag list and at the same time called "deliberately omitted".
- **Upstream strictness changes** (like `format` in an inline rule_set on 1.14):
  every "the core became stricter" is a candidate for an import sanitiser.

## Maintenance notes

- The full core reference is [KERNEL.md](../../../KERNEL.md); the contract process is
  [CONTRACT.md](../../../CONTRACT.md). The feature is a summary of rules, not a copy of those docs.
- Core specs (SPEC NNN) live in the fork's repo; contract SPEC 103 is in the
  launcher repo (the same-numbered `tasks/103-…` here is a different task).
- A fresh worktree has neither the AAR nor the contract copy — see
  [023-BUILD_CI_RELEASE](../023-BUILD_CI_RELEASE/FEATURE.md).
