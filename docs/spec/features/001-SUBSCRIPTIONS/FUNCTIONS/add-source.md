# Adding a source — subscription URLs, links, QR codes and files

A URL, pasted text, a QR code or a file becomes a subscription, a single server, a folder or a file
subscription in the list of sources.

| Field | Value |
|------|----------|
| Feature | [001-SUBSCRIPTIONS](../FEATURE.md) |
| Promises | — (relies on P1 on the first request) |
| State | ✅ written from code, 2026-09-28 |

## What it does

Accepts a node source from the user and creates an entry for it in the shared
list of sources: a subscription by URL, a single server, a folder or a file
subscription. After a successful add the config is rebuilt, and the new entry is
scrolled into view and highlighted.

## Parameters

No settings of its own. Entry points on the sources screen:

| Entry | What happens |
|---|---|
| Input field + "+" | the text is classified and added immediately |
| "+" with an empty field / "Paste from clipboard" | clipboard → analysis → confirmation dialog |
| "Scan QR code" (if there is a camera) | the string from the QR → the same analysis and confirmation |
| "Import from file…" | one file → see below; several → a new folder |
| "Get Public Test Servers" | a list from the community manifest; choosing one puts the source into the input field |

## Inputs / Outputs

**Input:** a string or file contents.
**Classification** (check order):

1. `http://` / `https://` → **subscription by URL**. The entry is created with an empty
   name and requested immediately; the name will be filled from `profile-title`, otherwise
   the list shows the host.
2. A WireGuard config, an Amnezia container, a link to one node, JSON — a **single
   server** (parsing — [002-NODE_IMPORT](../../002-NODE_IMPORT/FEATURE.md)).
3. Otherwise — "not recognized".

**Importing one file:** if it holds > 1 node, a
[file subscription](file-subscription.md) is created, named from `profile-title` or the file
name without extension; ≤ 1 node — a single server, the file name becomes a
hint for the node name. **Several files** → a new folder, one server from
each file; empty files are listed in the message.

**Output:** a new entry; a snackbar "Config regenerated: N nodes" (or "…& applied").

## Rules and invariants

- Clipboard and QR are untrusted input: before writing, a dialog shows the
  recognized type (Subscription URL + host, WireGuard config + endpoint,
  link, JSON) and the number of entries that will not become nodes, with reasons.
- An unrecognized clipboard → an "unknown format" dialog with a text preview.
- Empty clipboard → "Clipboard is empty"; empty file → "File is empty".
- Leaving the screen with a non-empty input field asks "Discard input?".
- A parse error of a single input opens a sheet with the rejection reason.
- A subscription by URL is added **even if the first request failed**: the entry
  stays with an error status and is retried in the usual order.
- The same URL can be added twice — there is no entry dedup.

## Boundaries

- Which formats are recognized and how — 002-NODE_IMPORT.
- Folders and single servers as entities — [007-NODE_LIST](../../007-NODE_LIST/FEATURE.md),
  [008-NODE_EDITOR](../../008-NODE_EDITOR/FEATURE.md).
- File picking and the camera depend on OS capabilities; without a file
  manager a hint is shown.
- The "Get Free VPN" preset with automatic rule setup (from `§010F`) no longer exists in the app
  and is not planned (owner decision 2026-09-29, audit [591](../../../tasks/591-spec-kit-revision-audit.md));
  public lists only put a URL into the field.
