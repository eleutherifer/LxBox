# lb-test.sh — exit-IP probe for load-balancing verification.
#
# WHAT:  Sends exactly ONE request to each of ~28 distinct "what's my IP"
#        services and reports the exit IP per domain, a grouped view, the
#        distribution, and the Shannon entropy of that distribution. The set of
#        distinct exit IPs = the nodes your load balancer is actually spreading
#        traffic across; the entropy says how evenly (1.0 = perfectly even).
#
# WHY:   To confirm an outbound load balancer is really distributing across
#        nodes — and not silently pinning everything to one. One request per
#        server, across MANY different servers, because a sticky /
#        consistent-hashing balancer pins a connection to a node BY
#        DESTINATION: hammering one domain always exits the same node and
#        proves nothing. Many distinct destinations are what reveal the spread;
#        more domains in the list => more nodes revealed.
#
# Runs anywhere bash + curl exist (built for Termux, also fine on Linux/macOS).
# =============================================================================
#
# Usage:
#   ./lb-test.sh                       # one request per server, concurrency 8
#   ./lb-test.sh 4                     # same, 4 requests in flight at once
#   PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:2080 ./lb-test.sh   # probe a specific node port
set -u

CONC="${1:-8}"          # how many requests run concurrently
TIMEOUT="${TIMEOUT:-8}" # per-request timeout (seconds)
PROXY="${PROXY:-}"      # optional curl proxy, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:2080

# Plain-text IP endpoints on DISTINCT domains, one request each. The more
# distinct destinations, the more nodes a consistent-hashing balancer reveals.
# The FAIL filter tolerates any that are down or rate-limiting on the day.
